Accenture Bootcamp final project. <br /> :shipit: 27/06/22-22/07/22


## Project Title :bulb:
A utility helping to organize students' music school auditions. 
This is a filter that allows you to see who is the teacher of a particular student, what class this student is in, what instrument he plays and who accompanies him. The received information can be displayed in a separate file and printed out. 

This filter is read-only and adding information is done manually through the database connected to the filter. It is possible to add the editor mode for the application in later updates. <br />
<br />
Below you can see the flow chart that describes the logics of the interface: <br />
